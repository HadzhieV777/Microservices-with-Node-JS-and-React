Mastering Microservices with Node JS and React

Instructor: Stephen Grider

Event-Based Architecture? Covered.
Server-Side Rendering with React? Absolutely.
Scalable, Production-Ready Code? It's all here.
🚀 Course Overview

Microservices are the go-to architecture for scaling modern applications — but mastering them isn’t easy. Most tutorials only skim the surface, leaving you unprepared for the real-world challenges. This course is different.

In this hands-on, full-stack course, you’ll dive deep into the most difficult parts of building microservices: event-based communication, data consistency, distributed systems issues, and complex deployment strategies. You’ll learn how to write scalable, maintainable, production-level code — without relying on opaque frameworks.

    "This is the course I wish I had when I was learning microservices." – Stephen Grider

🛠️ What You’ll Build

A complete, production-style multi-service application deployed with Docker and Kubernetes, featuring:

    A Server-Side Rendered frontend using React and Next.js

    Independent services built with Node, Express, and Typescript

    Shared authentication, custom event bus, and API contracts

    Databases like MongoDB and Redis

    Secure JWT-based authentication and authorization

    End-to-end testing and reusable shared libraries

🧠 What You’ll Learn

    Architect and build scalable microservices with real-world patterns

    Handle async, event-based communication with custom implementations

    Use Docker & Kubernetes to deploy your system in a real-world cloud setup

    Build SSR apps using React Hooks and Next.js

    Solve concurrency and ordering issues in distributed systems

    Share common code across services with custom NPM packages

    Enforce consistency and reliability across APIs and services

    Design, test, and secure your application like a professional

🔧 Technologies Used

    Frontend: React, Next.js (SSR), TailwindCSS

    Backend: Node.js, Express, Typescript

    Databases: MongoDB, Redis

    DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Skaffold

    Testing: Jest, Supertest

    Authentication: JWT

    Event Bus: NATS Streaming (custom integration)

📦 Requirements

    Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Express

    Some familiarity with the command line

    Optional: React knowledge is helpful, but not required

    Important: You’ll need to install Docker Desktop

    💼 If you're a Udemy Business user, check with your employer before installing Docker Desktop.

✅ By the End of the Course, You'll Be Able To:

    Design and build complex, production-ready microservices

    Deploy a full app to any cloud provider with Docker & Kubernetes

    Architect enterprise-grade systems using scalable design patterns

    Communicate across services with an efficient, event-driven system

    Test, document, and maintain large applications effectively

📚 Why This Course?

Unlike most courses that gloss over real-world complexity, this course goes deep. You’ll see and solve the actual challenges you'll face in production — from data replication headaches to managing async event streams — all taught by a seasoned software architect.
